Follow these steps! 👇
    
<b>1. Send URL</b>
If you want a custom caption on your video/file send the name/text you want to set on the video/file in the following format 👇
<b>Link * caption</b> (without extension). 
<i>[Separate the link and the caption name with "*" mark].</i>
<u>It is important that you separate with spaces the URL, * and the caption.</u>
<b>👍 Send something like this:</b>
<code>https://www.website.com/video.mp4 * caption text</code>
<b>🤡 Not like this:</b>
<code>❌ https://www.website.com/video.mp4*caption text ❌</code>
The caption/text you type will be automatically set as the custom name of the uploaded file 😎
<i><b>Note:</b> You can change/add any caption later if you want as explained in the end.</i>
<b>2. Then send custom thumbnail when asked while uploading the URL</b> (This step is optional) 
🔹 It means it is not necessary to send an image to include as an thumbnail.
If you don't send a thumbnail the video/file will be uploaded with an auto generated thumbnail from the video.
<i>(The thumbnail you send will be used for your next uploads)</i>
🔹 Press /delthumbnail if you want to delete the previously saved thumbnail.
<i>(Then the video will be uploaded with an auto-genarated thumbnail)</i>
<b>3. Select the button</b>
  <u>Video-option</u>: Give video/file in video format
  <u>File-option</u>: Give video/file in file format
   
<b>👉 Special feature: Set caption to any file you want! ✨</b>
🔹 Select an uploaded file/video or forward me <b>Any Telegram File</b> and just write the text you want to be on the file <b>as a reply to the file</b> by selecting it (as replying to a message) and the text you wrote will be attached as caption! 🤩
Ex: <a href='https://telegra.ph/file/0d4cf1d5677dda9311135.png'>Send Like This! It's Easy</a> 🥳"""
